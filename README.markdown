The FlipNumberView is simulating an analog flip display (like on airports).

It is using CoreAnimation to get the desired effect. It's well abstracted and should be really easy to use.
But it still needs some work. Feel free to contribute!

There will be a testproject in the future, but feel free to try the classes yourself right now.
