{"body":"JDFlipNumberView\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nSee [screenshots](#screenshots) below.\r\n\r\nThe Flip Number View is simulating an analog flip display (like those for the departure time on the airport).\r\n\r\nIt is using CoreAnimation to get the desired effect. It's well abstracted and should be really easy to use. But it still needs some work, so feel free to contribute!\r\n\r\n## Contents\r\n\r\nYou get three classes for different usecases:\r\n\r\n- `JDFlipNumberView`  \r\n  __A single animated digit.__ Range 0-9.\r\n- `JDGroupedFlipNumberView`  \r\n  A grouped and chained choosable number of flipviews for higher numbers.  \r\n  It is using a variable amount of `JDFlipNumberView` instances itself and chains them together.\r\n- `JDDateCountdownFlipView`  \r\n  __A date countdown.__ Just init with a target date and add it as a subview.  \r\n  It is using four `JDGroupedFlipNumberView` instances itself and chains them together.\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\nRecommend: Use [cocoapods] to install it.  \r\n\r\n(OR add all files from `JDFlipNumberView/JDFlipNumberView/` manually to your project, including the `JDFlipNumberView.bundle`.  \r\nAnd you also need to link the `QuartzCore.framework`)\r\n\r\nIn any case, after installing, you only need to follow these three steps, to use it:\r\n\r\n> 1. Init the class\r\n> 2. Set an int value (or a date)\r\n> 3. Start the animation\r\n\r\n__Example:__ A countdown view from 1000 seconds to 0.\r\n\r\n    JDGroupedFlipNumberView *flipNumberView = [[JDGroupedFlipNumberView alloc] initWithFlipNumberViewCount: 4];\r\n    flipNumberView.intValue = 1000;\r\n    [flipNumberView animateDownWithTimeInterval: 1.0];\r\n    \r\n    [self.view addSubview: flipNumberView];\r\n    flipNumberView.frame = CGRectMake(10,100,300,100);\r\n\r\nThat's it.  \r\nThis will display a working, flipping, animating countdown view!\r\n\r\n## How to start the animation?\r\n\r\nUse any of the following methods:\r\n\r\n    // basic animation\r\n    - (void) animateToNextNumber;\r\n    - (void) animateToPreviousNumber;\r\n    \r\n    // timed animation\r\n    - (void) animateUpWithTimeInterval: (NSTimeInterval) timeInterval;\r\n    - (void) animateDownWithTimeInterval: (NSTimeInterval) timeInterval;\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Overview](https://raw.github.com/jaydee3/JDFlipNumberView/master/Screenshots/menu.png \"Overview\")\r\n\r\n![Single Digit](https://raw.github.com/jaydee3/JDFlipNumberView/master/Screenshots/singledigit.png \"Single Digit\")\r\n\r\n![Date Countdown](https://raw.github.com/jaydee3/JDFlipNumberView/master/Screenshots/datecountdown.png \"Date Countdown\")\r\n\r\n\r\n[cocoapods]: https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/","note":"Don't delete this file!
